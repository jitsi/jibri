/**
 * [FileSink] represents a sink which will write to a media file on the
 * filesystem.  A maximum length of 125 characters is enforced for the filename.
 * NOTE: I considered letting the maximum length be configurable, but we require that we
 * are able to append a timestamp to the filename, so we can't give the caller full control
 * over the value anyway.  Because of that I just made the value hard-coded.
